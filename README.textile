== Purpose ==
Reliable radius proxy for accounting packets.
*This is not suitable for authentication*

Should implement 2 basic modes:
1. Accounting Start is received and replied right away. Proxied requests are made in the background to final servers. (async)
2. Accounting Start is received and reply is only sent after all final servers ack'ed the request. (sync)

Besides the naming (async/sync) all operations rely on libev reactor and are asynchronours.

== Requirements ==
* libev (shipped)
* glib > 2.24.0 (maybe will remove this)

== Usage ==
