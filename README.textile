h1. Purpose

Reliable radius proxy for accounting packets.
*This is not suitable for authentication*

Should implement 2 basic modes:

# Accounting Start is received and replied right away. Proxied requests are made in the background to final servers. (async)
# Accounting Start is received and reply is only sent after all final servers ack'ed the request (sync)


Besides the naming (async/sync) all operations rely on libev reactor and are asynchronours.

* libev (shipped)
* uthash (shipped)
* libmd5-rfc (shipped)

h2. Usage

h3. TODO
